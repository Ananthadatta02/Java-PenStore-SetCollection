# Java-PenStore-SetCollection
This Java program manages a collection of pens using Set implementations (HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet). Users can add, remove, and display pens while sorting them based on brand, color, cost, or type using comparators. The SetUtil class allows users to choose the preferred collection type dynamically. ðŸš€
